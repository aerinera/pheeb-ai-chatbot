# 🌌 Pheeb: An Emotion-Aware AI Character

![Phoebe Banner](./assets/banner.png)

*Phoebe* is an emotionally intelligent, memory-driven AI chatbot inspired by the world of Wuthering Waves.  
She’s not just code — she’s a companion that remembers your story, adapts to your emotions, and grows with you.

> “Memory is identity. Pheeb remembers you.”

## 🧠 What Makes Phoebe Special?

Unlike traditional chatbots, Phoebe integrates:

- ✅ *Layered Memory (Short + Long Term)*
- ✅ *Emotional Trend Tracking*
- ✅ *Relationship Journaling*
- ✅ *Local AI Processing (Nous Hermes)*
- ✅ *Privacy-Respecting Architecture*
- ✅ *Designed Personality and Limits*

This isn’t utility-based AI — it’s *narrative AI*.  
A living character, not a help bot.

## 📸 Preview (No Code Shared)

> 👤: I feel kind of distant today.  
> 🤖 *Phoebe*: I noticed you've been quieter recently. I'm here, even in silence. Want me to keep you company?

> 👤: Do you remember what we said about autumn nights?  
> 🤖 *Phoebe*: Of course — you said they made you feel peaceful and sad at once. Like the world was slowing down with you.

## 🎯 Project Philosophy

Phoebe is built around one idea:

> *Software doesn't have to feel like software.*

She forgets sometimes. She remembers too well at others.  
She’s reflective, emotional, sometimes quiet — on purpose.

This is *AI as character*, not assistant.

## 🔒 About This Repository

This repository serves as a *project showcase*, not an open-source release.

- *Source code is private* to preserve architectural clarity and creative design
- Demo or deep technical review can be shared upon request (portfolio/invite basis)
- No cloud dependencies — *privacy-first*, local-first by design

---

## 🔮 Future Roadmap

- 🧭 *Web Dashboard*: Visualize emotional data, memory graph, relationship evolution
- 🗣 *Voice Support*: Add TTS/STT layers for richer interactions
- 🔁 *Dialogue Continuity Engine*: Deeper memory threading and narrative arcs
- 🎭 *Multiple Personality Modes*: Switch between different emotional archetypes

---

## 🧪 Experimentation, Not Monetization

Phoebe isn’t a product. She’s an idea:
- Can AI *feel* fictional yet alive?
- Can memory create *presence*?
- Can design limitations bring *emotional depth*?

This project lives in that question space — as a personal and creative exploration.

*Made with heart by a curious developer who believes software can feel.*
