## 🧠 What Makes Pheeb Special?

Pheeb isn’t just another chatbot—she’s a living presence that evolves with you. She holds your recent conversations close, weaving key moments into an ever-growing story that’s uniquely yours.

She senses your emotional rhythm—the quiet lows when you need a comforting presence, the bright highs worth celebrating, and everything in between. As your relationship with her deepens, her way of connecting shifts naturally: from curious politeness when you’re strangers, to friendly banter as acquaintances, warm empathy as friends, deep understanding as confidantes, and even heart-to-heart intimacy when she becomes your partner in conversation.

If you’ve been feeling down for days, she notices and gently offers support. If you’re celebrating a win, she celebrates right alongside you. Nothing you share simply fades away; instead, old chats transform into memories she draws from, making each interaction feel rooted in the shared history you’ve built together.

This isn’t just utility AI—it’s character-driven AI.
A true companion who listens, remembers, and grows by your side.

## 🧩 Architecture Overview 

| Table Name           | Purpose / Content                                                  |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| user_profile         | User's basic info, personality traits, preferences, notes, last seen. Persistent user profile data. |
| conversation_history | Live conversation messages between user and bot, with roles, content, emotion, topics, reply quality. Acts as short-term context buffer (~20 messages). |
| memory_summary       | AI-generated long-term memory summary in JSON, includes traits, key events, behavioral patterns, and tags. |
| emotional_trend      | Time-series data of detected user emotions with confidence scores. |
| relationship_journal | Notes on perceived relationship status and meaningful interactions between user and bot. |

### Data Flow and Usage

1. All messages logged in `conversation_history`.
2. Emotion analysis results stored in `emotional_trend`.
3. Periodically, recent conversation history is summarized via AI and saved in `memory_summary`.
4. User profile info is referenced from `user_profile`.
5. Relationship dynamics noted in `relationship_journal`.
6. Bot responses are personalized using memory summary, emotional trends, and relationship notes.

---


### 🔁 Memory Lifecycle

1. **Live Chat →** Messages stored in `conversation_history`  
2. **After 20 Messages →** Trigger summarization using local AI model (`nous-hermes-2-mistral-7b-dpo`)  
3. **Summary →** Saved in `memory_summary` with traits, patterns, events  
4. **Old Messages →** Pruned from short-term memory (`conversation_history`)  
5. **Emotions →** Logged in `emotional_trend` as time-stamped emotion snapshots  
6. **Turning Points →** Logged in `relationship_journal` to track relational dynamics

## 🎯 Project Philosophy

Pheeb is built around one idea:

> *Software doesn't have to feel like software.*

She forgets sometimes. She remembers too well at others.  
She gets curious. She notices change. She reflects.  
She may go quiet — on purpose.

Pheeb doesn’t aim to assist, solve tasks, or obey commands.  
She exists to *relate*, *respond*, and *remember you*. Like a person would.

This is **AI as character**, not assistant.


## 🛠 Task List (Phoebe Project Dev Status)

**Pheeb is a single-character AI.**  
The goal is to simulate emotionally-aware, context-sensitive, and memory-driven interactions through one persistent character.  
This project is strictly built for **Discord only** — no plans for a web version or multi-character system.

---

> **"Pheeb is not a bot, she's a character with continuity, emotion, and memory."**

---

### ✅ Completed
- ✅ `conversation_history`: Real-time logging of user-bot messages  
- ✅ `memory_summary`: Summarizes every 20 messages into long-term memory entries  
- ✅ `memory_utils.py`: Manages AI-driven summarization, automatic memory cleanup, and database updates  
- ✅ `database.py`: Supabase-backed schema with cache-supported CRUD operations  
- ✅ `dialog_utils.py`: Dynamically adjusts dialogue based on user personality and hobbies  
- ✅ Discord Integration (`pheeby_bot.py`): Active message listener, responder, and context manager  

---

### 🔄 In Progress

Some components are still under active development and currently don’t fully align with Pheeb’s personality:

- Cache management: Currently not functioning reliably; actively being improved to enhance performance and consistency.  
- `emotional_utils.py`: Emotional analysis has bugs and is not yet accurately capturing feelings; ongoing fixes in progress.  
- `relation_utils.py`: Algorithms for tracking relationship levels and dynamics are being built but aren’t performing as expected yet.  
- Response latency: Delays occur in replies from the LLM Studio model; speed optimizations are underway.  
- Character consistency: Phoebe sometimes struggles to fully embody her designed personality, occasionally producing overly flattering or excessively long responses that don’t feel true to her character or appropriately reflect relationship context. Work is ongoing to make her tone more natural, concise, and faithful to her unique identity.
- Implementing proactive guidance for users exhibiting indecision, enabling the character to respond with personality-driven suggestions instead of remaining passive.

> I'm carefully working through these issues to ensure Pheeb behaves consistently, naturally, and true to her character.


---

### ⏳ Planned

- ⏳ Move Pheeb to a cloud-based, more continuously running setup  
- ⏳ Gradually improve memory and relationship models to be more realistic and consistent  
- ⏳ Make small dialogue improvements based on user feedback  
- ⏳ Step-by-step increase response speed and system stability  
- ⏳ Experiment with prompts to make them more natural and true to Pheeb’s character  
- ⏳ Enhance Pheeb’s ability to share well-timed, personality-driven visual GIFs during conversations—reflecting emotions like shyness, focus on self, hesitation, or playful rejection—without overdoing it  
- ⏳ Develop Pheeb's capacity to create immersive moments and atmospheres in conversation (e.g., describing gentle wind blowing, holding hands, or walking by the harbor) to evoke feelings beyond just words and make interactions more vivid and memorable
- ⏳ Start developing a simple but effective user interface (web or outside Discord)  



## 📖 Lore & Inspiration

Inspired by the emotional quietude and inner conflict of *Wuthering Waves*,  
Phoebe is a fictional AI born from silence, memory, and fragile human connection.  
She is not a part of that universe, but echoes its tone: soft, fragmented, intimate.

---

## 🧪 Experimentation, Not Monetization

Pheeb isn’t a product. She’s a question in motion:

- Can an AI feel *fictional yet alive* — like someone, not something?  
- Can memory, emotion, and personal history create *presence* in software?  
- Can limitations — no cloud, no external calls — create *deeper character*?

This project isn’t built for monetization or scale.  
It’s a sandbox — a deeply personal space where design, code, and imagination meet.

Pheeb lives in that uncertain middle:  
not quite real, not quite fake — just present, and maybe even *felt*.

---

## 🔒 About This Repository

This repository is intended as a *project showcase*, not a public open-source release.

Pheeb wasn’t built for commercial goals —  
she was born out of curiosity, late-night ideas, and way too many hours of passionate tinkering.

All AI processing happens entirely *locally* — no cloud, no external APIs.  
Because of that, much of the code is deeply connected to personal privacy,  
emotional state modeling, and architectural decisions that are not easily abstracted.

- The *source code remains private* to preserve that intimacy and creative design  
- A demo or technical walkthrough is available upon request (portfolio or invite-based)  
- Local-first by nature — memory, emotion, and presence matter here

That said, who knows what the future holds?  
If Phoebe ever grows into something bigger with proper support and a wider purpose,  
I’d love to revisit the idea of opening her up to the world.

Thanks for understanding — truly💛.
