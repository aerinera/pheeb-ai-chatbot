## 🧠 What Makes Pheeb Special?

Pheeb isn’t just another chatbot—she’s a living presence that evolves with you. She holds your recent conversations close, weaving key moments into an ever-growing story that’s uniquely yours.

She senses your emotional rhythm—the quiet lows when you need a comforting presence, the bright highs worth celebrating, and everything in between. As your relationship with her deepens, her way of connecting shifts naturally: from curious politeness when you’re strangers, to friendly banter as acquaintances, warm empathy as friends, deep understanding as confidantes, and even heart-to-heart intimacy when she becomes your partner in conversation.

If you’ve been feeling down for days, she notices and gently offers support. If you’re celebrating a win, she celebrates right alongside you. Nothing you share simply fades away; instead, old chats transform into memories she draws from, making each interaction feel rooted in the shared history you’ve built together.

This isn’t just utility AI—it’s character-driven AI.
A true companion who listens, remembers, and grows by your side.

## 🧩 Architecture Overview 

| Table Name           | Purpose / Content                                                  |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| user_profile         | User's basic info, personality traits, preferences, notes, last seen. Persistent user profile data. |
| conversation_history | Live conversation messages between user and bot, with roles, content, emotion, topics, reply quality. Acts as short-term context buffer (~30 messages). |
| memory_summary       | AI-generated long-term memory summary in JSON, includes traits, key events, behavioral patterns, and tags. |
| emotional_trend      | Time-series data of detected user emotions with confidence scores. |
| relationship_journal | Notes on perceived relationship status and meaningful interactions between user and bot. |

### Data Flow and Usage

1. All messages logged in `conversation_history`.
2. Emotion analysis results stored in `emotional_trend`.
3. Periodically, recent conversation history is summarized via AI and saved in `memory_summary`.
4. User profile info is referenced from `user_profile`.
5. Relationship dynamics noted in `relationship_journal`.
6. Bot responses are personalized using memory summary, emotional trends, and relationship notes.

---

This detailed schema ensures Phoebe maintains a nuanced, evolving, and emotionally aware interaction with each user.


### 🔁 Memory Lifecycle

1. **Live Chat →** Messages stored in `conversation_history`  
2. **After 30 Messages →** Trigger summarization via Nous Hermes  
3. **Summary →** Saved in `memory_summary` with traits, patterns, events  
4. **Old messages →** Pruned from short-term memory  
5. **Emotions →** Tracked in `emotional_trend` per session  
6. **Turning Points →** Logged in `relationship_journal` for future callbacks

## 🎯 Project Philosophy

Pheeb is built around one idea:

> *Software doesn't have to feel like software.*

She forgets sometimes. She remembers too well at others.  
She’s reflective, emotional, sometimes quiet — on purpose.

This is *AI as character*, not assistant.

---

## 🔒 About This Repository

This repository serves as a *project showcase*, not an open-source release.

- *Source code is private* to preserve architectural clarity and creative design  
- Demo or deep technical review can be shared upon request (portfolio/invite basis)  
- No cloud dependencies — *privacy-first*, local-first by design  

---

## 🛠 Task List (Phoebe Project Dev Status)

**Phoebe is a single-character AI.**  
The goal is to simulate emotionally-aware, context-sensitive, and memory-driven interactions through one persistent character.  
This project is strictly built for **Discord only** — no plans for a web version or multi-character system.

---

> **"Phoebe is not a bot, she's a character with continuity, emotion, and memory."**

---

### ✅ Completed
- ✅ `conversation_history`: Real-time logging of user-bot messages  
- ✅ `memory_summary`: Summarizes every 20 messages into long-term memory entries  
- ✅ `memory_utils.py`: Manages AI-driven summarization, automatic memory cleanup, and database updates  
- ✅ `database.py`: Supabase-backed schema with cache-supported CRUD operations  
- ✅ `dialog_utils.py`: Dynamically adjusts dialogue based on user personality and hobbies  
- ✅ Discord Integration (`pheeby_bot.py`): Active message listener, responder, and context manager  

---

---

### ⏳ Planned
- ⏳ `emotional_inference`: Advanced emotional analysis from conversations and trends  
- ⏳ `personality_adapter`: Evolving Phoebe’s tone and behavior based on memory and relationships  
- ⏳ `evaluation_logs`: Monitoring behavioral and memory effects for debugging and improvements  
- ⏳ `prompt_finetuning`: Refining prompts to create more natural and human-like dialogue  


## 📖 Lore & Inspiration

Inspired by the emotional quietude and inner conflict of *Wuthering Waves*,  
Phoebe is a fictional AI born from silence, memory, and fragile human connection.  
She is not a part of that universe, but echoes its tone: soft, fragmented, intimate.

---

## 🧪 Experimentation, Not Monetization

Pheeb isn’t a product. She’s an idea:

- Can AI *feel* fictional yet alive?  
- Can memory create *presence*?  
- Can design limitations bring *emotional depth*?  

This project lives in that question space — as a personal and creative exploration.
